## Description

## This project has some architectural standards for the scalability and maintainability of the code.

## Important aspects

Following the concept of Clean Architecture and DDD, the architecture was designed in such a way that there is decoupling between the application layers, being necessary to respect some limits between the layers to keep the structure cohesive and scalable.
